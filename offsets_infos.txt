This offsets.json file allows you to use your own offsets.
By default, Nexus External gets the offsets from the github repo, which I try to update frequently.

You don't have to fill all the offsets, if an offset is left empty, the value from the github repo will be used for that offset.

The first 4 are necessary for the wallhack to work.

Some offset names were chosen arbitrarily by me because I didn't know their real name.
MaxOnlinePlayers = The number of slots on the server.
m_angRotation = the address of the vertical axis.
mat_fullbright = uses materialsystem.dll.
screengrab = the address that changes when a screengrab is in progress.
m_iIDEntIndex = the ID of the player who is on your crosshair, depends on dwLocalPlayer, present in the file because the offset has already changed once.
