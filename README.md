# Gmod-Nexus-External-ESP  
Nexus is a Python external wallhack, triggerbot, aimassist and bhop compiled with PyInstaller **for GMOD x64**.  
It's external : nothing is injected, no lua code is used/edited.  
  
The wallhack is not in game: it's another application which is on top of gmod.  
So it's impossible to detect, impossible to screengrab.
