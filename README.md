# Gmod-Nexus-External-ESP V2

## About
Nexus is an open-source Python external ESP, triggerbot and bhop compiled with PyInstaller **for GMOD x64**.  
It's external : nothing is injected, no lua code is used/edited.  
  
The visuals are not in the game: it's another application which is on top of gmod.  
So it's impossible to detect, impossible to screengrab.  

|Features|Methods|Undetectable

ESP|Reading game memory only|✅
Dynamic Crosshair|Reading game memory only|✅
Triggerbot|Reading game memory only|-
Bhop|Read and Write to game memory|-

## Common issues
I don't see the ESP:  
- Use video setting: **Borderless window**.

The cheat doesn't detect gmod:
- Use the beta gmod version: **Chromium x64**.

In Singleplayer the ESP doesn't work:
- Uncheck "Only Real Players"
